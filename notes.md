Display the next trains due to arrive at Great Portland Street underground station.

Required
========

1. List of available destinations
2. The next available time for each

- Display the trains by the platform they're arriving at
- Display the trains in order of which one is due next
- Have the output auto-update so it's always showing the latest information

Although they recommend registering, it isn't mandatory, and the relevant calls should work without an API key.
You might find your app is rate-limited but that's fine for this exercise.
